If a database has $n$ people in it, this does indeed protect the privacy of all folks not selected, but it really sucks for the person whose information is released. Differentially privacy protects against this type of \"but only one person would be harmed\" argument. \n","\n","Formally, let $S$ = {Person $i$'s info gets published}. We can find a pair of neighboring databases $D$ and $D'$, such that $i$ is in $D$ but not $D'$. This is because there are neighboring databases where person $i$ is in one table (call it $D$), but not in the other (call it $D'$). So, $ \\mathbb{P}(M(D) \\in S) =1$ and $ \\mathbb{P}(M(D') \\in S) =0$ for any measurable set $S$.\n","\n","Thus, DP invalidates arguments of the form \"there is low risk for an individual to be harmed in this mechanism.\"\n","\n","Note that this definition also invalidates any truthful response to the query \"is person $i$ in the data?\" This follows by the exact same argument above - we can find two neighboring datasets in which person $i$ is in it (call it $D$) and another where person $i$ isn't included (call it $D'$). Then, $ \\mathbb{P}(M(D) \\in S) =1$ and $ \\mathbb{P}(M(D') \\in S) =0$, where $S \\subseteq \\{0,1\\}$.\n","\n","(2) This is done by the composition theorems. The fact that we add $\\epsilon$'s for each query means there is additional privacy leaked with each additional query. This relates to notion of a privacy budget, as it stops a would-be attacker from imposing un-due risk via repeated execution of a differentially private query system.\n","\n","(3) Yes. Differential privacy protects against linkage attacks, which is what this attack was. More spefically, this is guaranteed by the post-processing theorem.\n","\n","(4) For each query, use $\\frac{\\epsilon}{K}$ instead of epsilon. That way, after $K$ queries, the total privacy loss would be $\\epsilon$ but the composition theorem. Once this data has been queried $K$ times, retire the dataset.\n","\n","(5) Since there are possibly an infinite number of queries, we have to be a bit sneakier. For query $i$ we can use $\\frac{\\epsilon}{2^{i}}$ instead of $\\epsilon$. This way, the total privacy loss over an infinite number of queries is $\\epsilon$ by a routine application of the geometric series."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"KrcF2xal9vwj","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Exercise 2"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"R4k9ZyxZ9vwk","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Suppose we have access to a database of individuals in a county, containing information on whether or not an individual has commited a felony or not.
